        projectDescription: 'Full-stack car dealership web app using React (TypeScript) for the front-end and Java Spring Boot for the back-end, with secure JWT authentication and role-based access for dealers, users, and admins. Dealers could manage cars with CRUD functionalities, image uploads, and geolocation for map display. I also integrated an AI-powered chatbot via FastAPI, voice recognition, social media sharing, 360Â° car views, and QR code generation for dealer info. The app was deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker containers, with AWS RDS MySQL for data management. End-to-end testing ensured functionality and scalability.\nTechnologies used included React, TypeScript, Java Spring Boot, FastAPI, AWS, Docker, and MySQL.',

        projectDescription: 'Static-typed toy language interpreter in Java, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The interpreter includes support for procedures, variable handling, and efficient memory management using both stack and heap structures. I implemented multithreading capabilities with synchronization mechanisms like semaphores and barriers to ensure smooth execution. To enhance usability, I designed a JavaFX-based graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to visualize and debug the interpreter\'s execution step-by-step. This project focused on building a robust and interactive tool for interpreting and managing complex language features.',

It operates in stealth mode, allowing it to run covertly without user detection. The keylogger logs each pressed key to a designated file, ensuring detailed record-keeping. It includes a persistence feature to ensure automatic execution at system startup, providing consistent monitoring. For added security, the logged data is encrypted, and encrypted email notifications can be sent to a specified address. This project aims to demonstrate keylogging techniques while emphasizing responsible and authorized use.',
